🤖 Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025 – Task 2

This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025, focused on predictive modeling using the Geldium dataset. This task builds on insights from Task 1 (EDA) and applies GenAI-powered methods to design a responsible and explainable credit risk model.

📌 Task Objective
To create a structured predictive modeling plan that helps identify customers at risk of delinquency, using AI/ML approaches supported by GenAI tools.

Key objectives included:

✅ Developing model logic for binary classification (delinquent or not)
✅ Selecting and justifying the appropriate model (Logistic Regression)
✅ Planning for model evaluation using industry-standard metrics
✅ Addressing ethical considerations: bias, fairness, and explainability
🛠️ Tools & Platform Used
GenAI tools like ChatGPT & Gemini (for logic generation and refinement)
Prompt-driven modeling approach
Microsoft Word – final plan drafted and formatted for submission
Dataset provided via GNI platform
🧠 GenAI Prompt Used
"Suggest a predictive modeling approach for credit delinquency using features like income, credit score, and missed payments. Explain model choice and evaluation metrics."
